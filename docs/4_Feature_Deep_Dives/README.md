## Purpose

Feature-specific documentation lives here to keep the root `docs/` folder organized and focused on high-level architecture and planning documents. Each file in this folder provides an in-depth look at how a particular feature or flow works.

## When to Add Documentation Here

Add new documentation to this folder when documenting:
- Implementation details of specific features
- Flow diagrams for complex user journeys
- Screen-specific guides (e.g., admin panels, settings pages)
- Deep technical dives into particular subsystems
